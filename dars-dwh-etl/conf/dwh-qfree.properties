# This file defines installation-specific variables that should be viewable only
# by Q-Free and edited only by Q-Free. These variables must be merged into
# kettle.properties after an upgrade or after this file is modified.
#
# If the names (keys) of any of these properties are changed, you should remove
# the property with the old name from kettle.properties. This is to keep the
# content of kettle.properties as compact and understandable as possible.
