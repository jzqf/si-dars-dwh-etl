PDI "compare" algorithm improved:

	The PDI "compare" algorithm has been improved for reporting discrepancies for
	"updateable" tables. In the new, improved algorithm rows that have been updated
	in a source table _after_ the timestamp for which the source and target tables 
	have been last synchronized by the ETL job will not be considered when reporting
	the number of "changed" rows. Such updates will be propagated to the target 
	table on the *next* run of the ETL job and, therefore, should not be considered
	to be real discrepancies. The previous behaviour reported such updates as 
	"changed" discrepancies, which made it difficult to identify _actual_ 
	discrepancies due to errors in the ETL algorithm or other unknown causes.

Bug fixed in ETL progress reporting:

A bug in the progress reporting by the ETL job caused incorrect values to be
reported for the number of rows processed and the number of rows remaining to
be processed for a table. This has been corrected.
