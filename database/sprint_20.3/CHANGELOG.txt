*	The content notification email that is sent when the ETL process terminates 
	has been improved for the case when the ETL job is terminated by a shutdown
	request. Previously, the email indicated that an error occurred, which is
	not correct. Now, the email will explain the the job was terminated in a
	controlled manner by a shutdown request.
	

QFC-BODARS-4957:

*	If the ETL process is shut down or terminated for any other reason, the 
	attachment to the notification email will now include update statistics for 
	the table that was being processed when the ETL process was terminated. 
	Update statistics for the table being processed will also be persisted in
	the etl_mgmt database.
	
	Previously, update statistics were provided and persisted only for tables
	that were fully processed by the ETL job, not for tables that we being
	processed when the ETL job was terminated.

QFC-BODARS-4967, QFC-BODARS-4968, QFC-BODARS-4969:

*	It is now possible to compare a *single* target table with its source table
	for a range of "insert id" values. Previously, it was only possible to
	compare a specified number of the most *recently inserted* rows of a table.
	
	A shell script is provided to simplify using this new functionality.

*	It is now possible to compare DWH content associated with passages that 
	occurred between specified "from" and "to" timestamps. More specifically,
	the "from" and "to" timestamps are used to select rows to compare from the 
	"passage_events" table. SQL joins are performed with other passage-related
	tables to select rows to compare from these related tables.
	
	This compare can be performed between the obo_opr database and the PSA, or
	between the PSA and DSA. 
	
	Shell script are provided to simplify using this new functionality.

QFC-BODARS-4937:

*	The metadata in the etl_mgmt database has been updated to support the

		both the PSA and DSA:

		*	origin_domain_id
		*	origin_control_point_id
		*	origin_road_section_id

	*	Table 
	
			obo__svc_lvl_impact_domain 
		
		has been renamed to 
		
			obo__svc_lvl_domain 
			
		in both the PSA and DSA.

	*	Table 
	
			obo__svc_lvl_event_impact_register 
		
		has been renamed to 
		
			obo__svc_lvl_impact_register 
			
		in both the PSA and DSA.


	*	The following tables have bee added to both the PSA and DSA:

		*	obo__kpi_impact_type
		*	obo__svc_lvl_event_impact_map
		*	obo__svc_lvl_impact_details
		*	obo__svc_lvl_impact_status
