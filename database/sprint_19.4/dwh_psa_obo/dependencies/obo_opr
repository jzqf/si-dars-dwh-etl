This is, effectively, the same as version 1.13.4, except the following two
columns;

   passage_event_timestamp      TIMESTAMP            not null,
   external_reference_timestamp TIMESTAMP            not null,

have been added to the table:

	passage_event_derived_data

There is also a new index that is created, but that does not affect the metadata
that is created from this database.
