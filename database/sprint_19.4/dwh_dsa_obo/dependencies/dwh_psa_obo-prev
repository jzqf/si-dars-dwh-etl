0.15.3

It was necessary to generate an installation zip file artifact for this version
of the database by the following procedure:

1.	Check out tag 0.15.3 for the project si-dars-pdm-dwh

2.	Run Kym's VB script in PowerDesigner to generate new/updated build files.
	I should have done this after updating the .pdm file for this database and
	before committing the changes, but I did not know about this procedure then.

3.	Run "mvn clean install" on the si-dars-pdm-dwh project. This generated an
	artifact named:

		dars-pdm-dwh-psa_obo-0.15.3-database.zip ,

	which is the same name as the 0.15.3 artifact that can be downloaded from 
	the Q-Free Nexus server, but its content is different.
