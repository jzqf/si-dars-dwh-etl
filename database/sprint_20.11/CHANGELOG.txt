The work that was performed for this sprint was not merged to the develop
branch on the central "origin" repository because all of the related changes
that were necessary for the work here to be completed and fully tested was not
completed during this sprint. Therefore, the work performed during this sprint 
will be rolled into the next, 20.12, sprint.

TSDSD-667:	ETL App: Add monitoring and shutdown control for new algorithm

*	Added configuration parameter QF_CDC_CONTROL_TABLE_BATCH_SIZE to config
	projects for each environment for the si-dars-dwh-etl project:

# When deleting rows from a target table using an "etl_cdc_*" control table in
# the source database, the ETL will delete target rows and their corresponding
# "etl_cdc_*" control table rows in transactions that process this number of 
# rows from both tables.
QF_CDC_CONTROL_TABLE_BATCH_SIZE=100


TSDSD-668:	ETL App: Update metadata to use new ETL algorithm(s) for selected tables 

	Nothing was done here because no tables were selected to use the new 
	algorithm and this work was not merged to the develop branch on the central 
	"origin" repository.
