*	Updated ETL metadata so that the name of the primary key is updated to 
	"sid_role_id" for database tables:
	
	*	mon_opr.sid_roles
	*	obo_opr.sid_roles
	*	odms_opr.sid_roles
	*	dwh_psa_obo.mon__sid_roles
	*	dwh_psa_obo.obo__sid_roles
	*	dwh_psa_obo.odms__sid_roles

	This was an error/bug that was introduced into the 21.02 release.


*	Updated ETL metadata so that:

	*	PSA database dwh_psa_obo:
	
		*	Table: mon__alarms

			Change ETL algorithm from #6 ("updateable" table) to #10 ("updateable" + delete)
	
		*	Table: mon__alarm_actions

			Change ETL algorithm from #1 ("insert-only" table) to #9 ("insert-only" + delete)
	
		*	Table: mon__data_collection_source

			Change ETL algorithm from #6 ("updateable" table) to #10 ("updateable" + delete)
	
		*	Table: obo__applied_rating_detail_data

			Change ETL algorithm from #9 ("insert-only" + delete) to #11 ("updateable" + delete (updates & deletes via etl_cdc_xxxxx table))

	*	DSA database dwh_dsa_obo:
	
		*	Table: mon__alarm

			Change ETL algorithm from #6 ("updateable" table) to #10 ("updateable" + delete)
	
		*	Table: mon__alarm_actions

			Change ETL algorithm from #1 ("insert-only" table) to #9 ("insert-only" + delete)
	
		*	Table: mon__data_collection_source

			Change ETL algorithm from #6 ("updateable" table) to #10 ("updateable" + delete)
	
		*	Table: obo__applied_rating_detail_data

			Change ETL algorithm from #9 ("insert-only" + delete) to #11 ("updateable" + delete (updates & deletes via etl_cdc_xxxxx table))


https://q-free.atlassian.net/browse/TSDSD-1020: ETL App: Implement new algorithm (#11)

*	Added ETL algorithm #11. This algorithm treats both updates and the 
	deletion of rows from target tables using "etl_cdc_xxxxx" control tables.

*	Added configuration parameter QF_CDC_CONTROL_TABLE_BATCH_SIZE_UPDATES to 
	config projects for each environment for the si-dars-dwh-etl project:

# When updating rows from a target table using an "etl_cdc_*" control table in
# the source database, the ETLjob  will update target rows and delete their 
# corresponding "etl_cdc_*" control table rows in transactions that process 
# batches of this number of rows from each table.
QF_CDC_CONTROL_TABLE_BATCH_SIZE_UPDATES=5000
